# Practical-Flow-Sensor
This project features a motorized valve control mechanism within a pipe system. The valve adjusts fluid flow based on data from a flow sensor, which is compared to a set point by a controller. In a closed-loop system, both On/Off and PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control strategies were tested and implemented to optimize performance.
