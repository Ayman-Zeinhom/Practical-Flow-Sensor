# Practical-Flow-Sensor
This project features a motorized valve control mechanism within a pipe system. The valve adjusts fluid flow based on data from a flow sensor, which is compared to a set point by a controller. In a closed-loop system, both On/Off and PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control strategies were tested and implemented to optimize performance.

# Tools Used:
- ### Simulink: To module the p controllers(p-pi-pd-pid) for the closed loop system 
- ### Arduino: To implement code for the pump and servo motor and water flow sensor and 6 modes (on/off- 50% set-point-4 p controllers)
